# zkp-cli

A cli toolkit for zkp.

*Currently zkp-cli uses the already implemented gadgets as separate circuits for a simple demonstration. As more zkp algorithms are added in the future, we will refactor and add more features to zkp-cli.*

## Usage

- **YOU NEED TRUSTED-SETUP** to run Groth16 scheme
  - `cargo run --bin trusted-setup mimc` (Proving key and verification key will be generated in the `trusted_setup` directory)
  - The random common reference string (CRS) generated in this way is for testing purposes only. These parameters would have to be generated securely by a trusted setup, which is normally through a trusted third party or a multi-party computation.

- Use default groth16 as scheme and bn_256 as curve, and prove knowledge of the preimage of a MiMC hash invocation which is the secret string.
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-prove mimc --string=iamsecret` (A proof file will be generated at `proofs_files` directory)
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-verify mimc proofs_files/mimc.groth16-bn_256.proof`

- Use custom schemes and curves as backend, and prove knowledge of the preimage of a MiMC hash invocation which is the file value.
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-prove mimc groth16 bls12_381 --file=README.md` (A proof file will be generated at `proofs_files` directory)
  - `cargo run --bin zkp-verify mimc groth16 bls12_381 proofs_files/README.md.mimc.groth16-bls12_381.proof`
